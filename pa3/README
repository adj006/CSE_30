             of a word read from stdin.

How to compile: Typing "make" in the command prompt.

How to run it: 2 cases
	case 1: typing "the file name" in the command prompt.

	case 2: typing "the file name, --build, and /usr/dict/words"

An example of normal output: type "./anagrams --build /usr/dict/words"
                             in command prompt.

Anagram database file "anagrams.dat" built.

An example of abnormal/error output: type "./anagrams --build"

Usage: anagrams [--build dictionary_file] 

How I tested program:
./anagrams 
 
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: 
 
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: tops 
Anagram(s) are: post spot stop 
  
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: angel 
Anagram(s) are: Galen Lange angel angle glean 
 
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: fubar 
No anagrams found.

Anything else: start early on this assignment. Also this prints out
               the anagrams from the word you entered.
