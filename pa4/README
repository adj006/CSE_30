An example of abnormal/error output: type "./myls -g"
./myls: illegal option -- g
Usage: ./myls [-alrt] [file ...]


How I tested program:
	I tested this program by testing all the files provided in the readme
	and also tested all the option flags and compared it with the pa4test.

Anything else: start early on this assignment. Also this prints out
               similar to the unix "ls" command.
